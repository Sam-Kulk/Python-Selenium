1. XPath by attribute
-------------------------
When to use : when a proper attribute is present for the element to locate it uniquely, like id & name.

//input[@id='bmwcheck']

Note: attribute value will be case sensitive

2. XPath by multiple attributes
=================================================================
When to use : when more than one attributes are required to locate element uniquely

Considering two attributes are required to locate the element
//input[@name='cars' and @value='bmw']

Note:
1. I can also make use of 'or' operator, but it is not the good practice, 'and' operator the one that is mostly used.
2. Example for 'or' usage is Button Start/Stop

3. XPaths by text()
------------------------------
When to use : when there are no proper attributes present for the element to locate it uniquely & the element has some text on it with which it can be identifyied uniquely.

//button[text()='Open Window'] or //button[.='Open Window']

Note:
- . = text()
- text will be case sensitive.
