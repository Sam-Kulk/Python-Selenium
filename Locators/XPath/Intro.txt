XPath
-------------------------
XPath - XML Path
XPath is basically a type of locator that is actually the address/location of the web element on the HTML DOM of the web page.

Note:
1. DOM - Document Object Model
2. XPath is the most preferred locator

Types
1. Absolute
2. Relative

Absolute vs Relative
-----------------------
1. The Absolute XPath starts from the root node/tag i.e. html and navigates till the element in the DOM
whereas the Relative XPath does not starts from root tag instead it directly jumps on the element on the DOM.

2. Absolute XPath expression starts with '/', whereas the Relative XPath expression starts with '//'.

3. In Absolute XPath expression only tags & index are used, whereas in the Relative XPath expression the attributes are also used.

4. The Absolute XPath expression will be usually very lengthy compared to the Relative XPath

5. The Relative XPath is more stable/static, since in Abs XPath we use only tags & index i.e. hierarchy & this hierarchy will be affected whenever some changes are done in the webpage

6. Relative XPath is relatively faster.

Note:
1. Relative XPath is preferred
2. Selectors Hub is a browser extension/plugin that is used to generate, write & verify the XPaths

Relative XPath
----------------------------------------
Syntax: //tag[@attribute='value']
where '@' Indicates to  find element in all directions
