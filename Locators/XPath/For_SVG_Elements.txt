The svg tag is basically used for the icons on the web page.
The svg tag is not supported in the XPath syntax.

The right way for writing XPath for svg elements is:
//*[local-name()='svg']
This local-name() is a function.

Note:
1. I can make use of attributes & indexing
Ex1: //*[local-name()='svg' and @data-icon='home']
Ex2: (//*[local-name()='svg'])[2]

2. Generally the path element will be the child element of the svg element, if I want Xpath
for that path element then the best approach is:
(//*[local-name()='svg'])[2]/*[local-name()='path'], because the path tag is also not supported
in Xpath syntax & also 'path' element will not have any proper attributes.

3. It is always not preferred to use XPath for the svg/path elements, it is better to make use of
any of its proper parent elements.
