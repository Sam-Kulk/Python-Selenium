If I am not to generate a proper XPath for the element by all different ways mentioned, then the last option is
"Xpath by grouped index".

It is suggested to use this way only after trying all the other ways.

Syntax: (XPath)[index]

Note: In Selenium indexing starts from '1'

Ex1: (//input[@type='radio'])[2]
Ex2: (//input[@type='radio'])[last()] : last() function for last index
Ex3: (//input[@type='radio'])[last()-1]
