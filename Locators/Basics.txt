LOCATORS
=============
Basically it is the address of the web element on the webpage.
Locators are used to locate/identify the web element on the web page, to perform certain action on it.

There are 8 types of locators
1. ID
2. Name
3. Link Text
4. Partial Link Text
5. Tag Name
6. class Name
7. CSS Selector
8. Xpath

Note:
1. ID,Name, Link Text & Partial Link Text locators are used to locate a single element.
2. Tag Name & class Name locators are used to find multiple elements.
3. CSS Selector & Xpaths locators allow the usage of other attributes including the ID & Name & also combination of them.
4. Xpath is the most effective locator as it has lots of features i.e traversing, text() & grouping

Basic html line
-----------------
<tag attribute1="value" attribute2="value" .....>text</tag>

Tags of different web elements
---------------------------------
textfield  -->  input
textarea field  -->  textarea
checkbox  -->  input
radiobutton  -->  input
button --> button
link --> a
image --> img
dropdown --> select
table --> table

Note:
1. I can differentiate the textfield, checkbox & radio buttons by type attribute
2. link will have mandatory attribute as "href" & img will have "src".


XPath vs CSS Selector
----------------------------
Using CSS Selector I cannot handle dynamic elements, as text() & backward, forward traversing
& traversing to siblings elements is not allowed in CSS Selector

Note:
CSS Selector can locate element only in one direction, Xpath can locate element in all direction.
