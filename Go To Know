close() v/s quit()
======================
- close() should be used to close current tab, when multiple tabs of browser are opened & quit() should be used to close entire browser, along with all it's tabs & it will kill the browser process running internally
- close() should not be used to close the browser, when single tab is opened, because it will not kill the browser process internally.
- quit() should be used.

find_element() v/s find_elements()
=====================================
- f_es() will returns the element objects all the elements(one or many) which are matching the specified locator as a list, whereas the f_e() will return element object of only one/first matching element even though multiple elements are matching with the locator.
- f_es() will return empty list if no elements match the specified locator, whereas the f_e() will throw 'NoSuchElement' exception.

os module
===================
It is a built-in module
It is having a function to get current working directory, which can used in specifying paths
Ex : os.getcwd()+"rest_of _the_loc"

- I can interact with database with the selenium-webdriver by importing the relavant package. For reference I can refer SDET Selenium-Python session 15.
