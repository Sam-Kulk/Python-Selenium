Basic Introduction
--------------------
Selenium is a tool that is basically used for automating web applications for functional testing purposes.
Selenium is open source
Selenium supports multiple languages like Python,Java,JavaScript etc..
Selenium supports multiple browsers like Chrome,Firefox,Edge etc..
Selenium supports multiple OSs like Windows,Linux,Mac

There are 4 components/flavours of selenium
--------------------------------------------
1. Selenium IDE - Record & Replay tool.
2. Selenium RC - Deprecated
3. Selenium Webdriver - Developed to overcome the limitations of the Selenium RC.
4. Selenium Grid - It is used for distributing the automation tests across different platforms & to run them parallely. This is basically used for automating the compatibility testing

Selenium architecture
----------------------
3.X
----                                                   JSON Wire Protocol                       W3C protocol
Selenium Language Binding(Python +Selenium Webdriver) ----------------------> Browser Driver ----------------> Browser

4.X
----                         W3C protocol                           W3C protocol
Selenium Language Binding ----------------------> Browser Driver ----------------> Browser

Note:
The browser driver will be the one that is going to perform the action on the web application running on the browser
In the 4.X the data communication is better since the use of w3c protocol uniformly

Things required for setting up the python-selenium automation
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Python
2. Pycharm IDE
3. Browser driver
4. Selenium package for python
5. Web application

Note:
Selenium Webdriver is a module in the Selenium package

Limitations of Selenium
--------------------------
1. Selenium can automate web-application not any other types of applications.
2. Does not have inbuilt reporting feature, it depends on third-party frameworks like TestNG
Robot etc. for reporting.
3. Cannot do Captcha validations.
